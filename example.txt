Abstract: Hydrogels exhibit excellent moldability, biodegradability, biocompatibility, and extracellular matrix- like properties, which make them widely used in biomedical fields. Because of their unique three- dimensional crosslinked hydrophilic networks, hydrogels can encapsulate various materials, such as small molecules, polymers, and particles; this has become a hot research topic in the antibacterial field. The surface modification of biomaterials by using antibacterial hydrogels as coatings contributes to the biomaterial activity and offers wide prospects for development. A variety of surface chemical strategies have been developed to bind hydrogels to the substrate surface stably. We first introduce the preparation method for antibacterial coatings in this review, which includes surface- initiated graft crosslinking polymerization, anchoring the hydrogel coating to the substrate surface, and the LbL self- assembly technique to coat crosslinked hydrogels. Then, we summarize the applications of hydrogel coating in the biomedical antibacterial field. Hydrogel itself has certain antibacterial properties, but the antibacterial effect is not sufficient. In recent research, in order to optimize its antibacterial performance, the following three antibacterial strategies are mainly adopted: bacterial repellent and inhibition, contact surface killing of bacteria, and release of antibacterial agents. We systematically introduce the antibacterial mechanism of each strategy. The review aims to provide reference for the further development and application of hydrogel coatings.

## 1. Introduction

In the current biomedical field, medical devices, such as catheters, hernia nets, implants, and wound dressings, are often adhered by bacteria, leading to varying degrees of infection and posing a threat to the health of patients [1]. Once bacteria adhere to the surface of the substrate, they will rapidly form a biofilm, which attracts more bacteria, affecting the antibacterial effect of the immune system [2]. Therefore, the prevention of bacterial infection in the process of biomaterial implantation has become the focus of researchers. Surface coating or modification, which preserves the original properties of the material and changes only the surface properties, has been recognized as a promising strategy for introducing antibacterial efficacy into biomaterials. Some bionic surface morphologies with high aspect ratios are effective against colonization by bacteria, although the mechanism of antibacterial activity is not clear [3- 8]. For methods of tailoring surface chemistry, substrates can be chemically modified or physically coated with a variety of antibacterial substances, including polymers, functional groups, inorganic nanoparticles, hydrogels, and antibiotics [9]. Among these bactericidal materials, hydrogel coating has many advantages and has been widely studied.

Hydrogels represent a polymer network system [10], i.e., a polymer with a threedimensional network structure that can crosslink water molecules in the system by combining hydrophilic residues with water molecules. They can absorb a large amount of water,

are swellable but do not dissolve in water, can maintain a specific shape, and have good elasticity [11]. Hydrogels can be fabricated from natural or synthetic polymers [12- 16]. The advantages and disadvantages of some hydrogel raw materials are shown in Table 1. Hydrogels are very similar to natural active materials and are an ideal material for the preparation of medical dressings [17], drug delivery systems [18- 20], and tissue engineering [21]. However, most hydrogels exhibit poor mechanical properties due to their uneven network structure and lack of energy dissipation mechanism, which lead to their limited application in the biomedical field. For example, hydrogels are easily deformed after repair of bone defects and thus need to be combined with other biomaterials or chemical modification to improve their performance. At present, biomaterials with hydrogel coating combine the excellent mechanical properties of implant devices and the biological properties of hydrogels, exhibiting excellent development prospects in the biomedical field [22]. Currently, the listed medical hydrogel coating products are mainly used in the catheters, stent delivery systems, and guide wires, among which the catheter accounts for the largest proportion, reaching  \(70\%\)  of sales in 2022. Brands include the Futae hydrogel coated latex catheter bag, the BIP catheter, and the Weili catheter.

The physical method of hydrogel coating to modify the surface of the biological substrate is simple, but it is not stable enough. The hydrogel coating is bonded to the surface of the substrate through a non- covalent bond, and the coating layer is easily delaminated from the surface [23,24]. Therefore, in order to improve the adhesion and stability of the hydrogel coating, it is necessary to use a chemical method (e.g., covalent bond) to attach the hydrogel coating [25,26]. Compared with other coatings (e.g., functional groups, self- assembled monolayers, and polymer brushes), hydrogel coatings exhibit many advantages. Firstly, hydrogel coatings have high grafting density and uniform coverage. Secondly, layer- by- layer (LbL) assembly coatings and polymer brush coatings are widely used, but the coating thickness has limitations. LbL hydrogel coatings are usually very

thin, generally less than  \(100\mathrm{nm}\) , and they take much time to deposit layer by layer. The thickness of polymer brush coatings is related to the length of the polymer chain, generally less than several hundred nanometers [27]. In contrast, hydrogel coatings can be prepared by spin coating, electrochemical deposition, surface- initiated graft polymerization, and other methods, so the thickness of the hydrogel coating can be flexibly controlled from nanometer to micrometer, providing sufficient space to coat polymers, particles, small molecules, and other substances. Thirdly, unlike the non- crosslinked surface coating, which is attached with the substrate only by one covalent bond, the hydrogel coating is attached by multiple points. Therefore, hydrogel coatings are more stable for long- term modification.

We can classify antibacterial hydrogel coatings into two categories according to the type of active ingredients. The first is compositions containing antibacterial substances, such as natural or synthetic cationic polymers [28,29], amphoteric polymers [30], and antibacterial peptides [31]. The second is loaded antibacterial substances, such as antibiotics [32], antibacterial analogues [33], nano- silver [34], and zinc oxide, in the three- dimensional hydrogel network [35]. At present, researchers have conducted extensive research on the application of antibacterial hydrogels, but the research on hydrogels as a surface coating is not comprehensive. In this paper, the preparation methods for antibacterial hydrogel coating and its application in the biomedical antibacterial field are reviewed in detail.

## 2. Preparation Methods of Hydrogel Coatings

Hydrogels are prepared by chemical and physical crosslinking, but it is challenging to fix physically crosslinked hydrogels on the surface of materials due to the lack of binding sites for binding into the three- dimensional network [36,37]. In addition, the poor mechanical properties of physically crosslinked hydrogels compared to chemically crosslinked hydrogels limit the application of physically crosslinked hydrogels as durable coating materials [38]. The chemically crosslinked hydrogels can be gelatinized by monomer polymerization or conjugation reactions between polymer chains, whereby we can attach these hydrogels to the material surface in various ways to form stable hydrogel coatings [39]. The general strategies can be divided into three types: The first is surface- initiated graft crosslinking polymerization. The second is anchoring the hydrogel coating to the substrate surface. Third is the LbL self- assembly technique to coat crosslinked hydrogels [2].

### 2.1. Surface-Initiated Graft Crosslinking Polymerization

Free radical polymerization is a crucial way to prepare polymeric materials. The polymerization reaction is initiated by active radicals located on the surface of the substrate, so the adhesion of hydrogels can be promoted by generating active radicals on the substrate surface and introducing grafting sites on the surface [40].

#### 2.1.1. Direct Generation of Reactive Radicals on the Substrate Surface

Polymer materials are widely used in biomedical fields (e.g., heart valves, catheters, contact lenses). Mature strategies have been established for surface modification of inorganic materials, but general methods for polymer surface chemical modification are still lacking due to the relatively low surface inertness and surface energy of polymers. The photografting reaction may introduce surface- active radicals to grow polymer brushes and hydrogel coatings on the surface [41]. In a typical photografting process, the Norrish II type photoinitiator, e.g., benzophenone (BP), is excited to a singlet state (BPS) under irradiation by UV light and is then transformed to a triplet state (BPT) by intersystem crossing. It is well recognized that BPT is capable of abstracting hydrogen from other molecules or even solid substrates (RH), which generates reactive radicals (R●) and relatively less reactive benzopinacol radicals (BP- OH●). In the presence of vinyl monomer, R● acts as a reactive species to initiate radical polymerization, while BP- OH● is stabilized by the conjugate effect from the benzene ring and is not able to attack monomers but will couple with reactive radicals. Since polymer materials have plenty of C- H bonds, it is convenient to conduct photografting reactions on them. There have been some reports on the preparation of

thin hydrogel layers by photografting on polymer substrates, and hydrogel coatings with antibacterial properties have also been investigated. For example, Zhang Fanjun et al. prepared a hydrogel antibacterial coating that can be applied to various blood- contacting devices (PVC and polyurethane pipes) (Figure 1) [42]. Free radical polymerization on the material surface was initiated with the photoinitiator benzophenone using an ultraviolet lamp. The dehydrogenation of benzophenone forms reactive radicals on the PVC polymer backbone and initiates monomer polymerization, resulting in a hybrid acrylamide and acrylic hydrogel coating. The inhibition zone test and confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that the hydrogel coating could maintain remarkable antimicrobial and antifouling properties for four weeks. Furthermore, the hydrogel coating decreased the platelet adhesion/activation without risk of hemolysis. The ex vivo blood circulation study confirmed the antithrombotic properties of the hydrogel coating. Using impregnation methods to coat antibacterial drugs,  \(\mathrm{Ag^{+}}\) , antibacterial peptides, and other substances may further improve the antibacterial properties of blood- contacting catheters. In another study, Fu Xiaoyi et al. prepared an ionic hydrogel coating doped with a  \(\mathrm{Ni^{2 + }}\)  trapping agent  \(\mathrm{CS}_2\)  on the surface of a Nitinol bone implant through radical polymerization technology initiated by photografting, which may effectively be antibacterial.  \(\mathrm{CS}_2\)  coated the released  \(\mathrm{Ni^{2 + }}\)  through chelating reaction to avoid cytotoxicity. This provides a research basis for embedding and detecting  \(\mathrm{Ni^{2 + }}\)  released from implantable biomaterials [43]. However, some polymers only have high- energy  \(\mathrm{C(sp^2) - H}\)  bonds, (e.g., polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyimide (PI)), which cannot be surface- modified by photo- grafting. Because the irradiation energy of traditional ultraviolet light is relatively low, these inert surfaces can be surface- modified by photo- grafting with excimer lasers.

#### 2.1.2. Introduction of Peroxide Groups on the Substrate Surface

2.1.2. Introduction of Peroxide Groups on the Substrate SurfaceRedox reactions between peroxide initiators and reducing agents may generate free radicals and initiate monomer polymerization. Peroxide groups may be activated under the irradiation of ultraviolet lamps, which initiates free radical polymerization. Therefore, the graft- crosslinking polymerization of hydrogels can be easily carried out on the surface, functionalized with peroxide groups. For example, Ma et al. prepared hydrogel coatings through a redox diffusion method in which  \(\mathrm{Fe}^{2 + }\)  mingled with the substrate material before 3D printing; when  \(\mathrm{Fe}^{2 + }\)  leached from the 3D printed structures, a redox reaction occurred with the persulfate ions  \(\mathrm{S}_2\mathrm{O}_8^{2 - }\)  immersed in the solution, triggering the formation of crosslinked hydrogels [44,45]. However,  \(\mathrm{Fe}^{2 + }\)  leaching may have harmful effects on the properties of the substrate material; thus, Wancura Megan et al. developed a new method [46] in which the adsorption of  \(\mathrm{Fe}^{2 + }\)  onto the substrate would not have these effects. Iron (II) gluconate was adsorbed onto the substrate through a molecular adsorption method and immersed in a mixture of ammonium persulfate (APS) solution and polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) to initiate a redox reaction between  \(\mathrm{S}_2\mathrm{O}_8^{2 - }\)  and  \(\mathrm{Fe}^{2 + }\)  to produce sulfate anions and free radicals. Then, the sulfate radicals triggered the vinyl groups of PEGDA, initiating free radical crosslinking from the surface to produce a hydrogel (Figure 2). The prepared hydrogel coating has a controllable thickness and is formed through a gentle method that has proven to be effective in improving biocompatibility and preventing thrombus formation in subsequent experiments.

#### 2.1.3. Introduction of Catechol Groups on the Substrate Surface

2.1.3. Introduction of Catechol Groups on the Substrate SurfaceCatechol groups can become functional on the surface of most organic or inorganic substrates [47]. The commonly used surface initiators of catechol groups include 3,4- dihydroxyphenylalanine and dopamine, which may form coatings with adhesive functionality on the surface of substrates through autoxidative polymerization mechanism. The generated quinones, amino groups, and phenolic hydroxyl groups can be used as reaction sites to combine with free radical polymerization initiators and promote graft crosslinking of hydrogels on the surface [48]. For example, in one study, Zhou et al. first deposited a layer of polydopamine on the surface of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) (American Braintree Scientific, Braintree, MA, USA) and then bonded the atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) initiator (α- bromoisobutyl bromide, BiBB was purchased from Sigma- Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) with hydroxyl and amino groups and fixed it to the surface of the catheter; the cationic monomer or crosslinker (polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate, PEGDMA was purchased from Sigma- Aldrich) initiated ATRP polymerization on the sur

face and formed an antibacterial hydrogel coating. The in vivo antibacterial and antibiofilm effect of these non- leachable covalently linked coatings (using a mouse catheter model) can be tuned to achieve a 1.95 log  \((98.88\%)\)  reduction and  \(1.26\log (94.51\%)\)  reduction of clinically relevant pathogenic bacteria (specifically with Methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, were kindly provided by Kimberly Kline's lab, which bought them from ATCC, Manassas, Virginia, USA) and Vancomycin- resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE)) [49]. This method of preparing antibacterial hydrogel coatings can also be used on small catheters with an inner diameter of  \(0.3\mathrm{mm}\) . In addition to radical polymerization, other methods can be used to prepare hydrogel coatings (e.g., Michael addition, Schiff- base addition, Diels- Alder addition). For example, Chen Yin et al. prepared an NOE hydrogel- coated stainless steel scaffold with nitric oxide elution [50]. The hydrogel precursor solution is directly coated on the surface of the scaffold. Due to the difference between melting point and body temperature, it is difficult to form a gel, so chemical crosslinking should be introduced. The study used the Michael addition reaction that promotes cytocompatibility. The previously used sulfhydryl- maleimide addition reaction was too fast and difficult to operate, so amine- maleimide addition was used instead of this reaction. Firstly, a P(DA- co- HDA) film layer was deposited on the stainless steel surface. The NOE hydrogel coating was prepared by coupling amine- maleimide and alginate, then crosslinking with gelatine and selenium species. The hydrogel coating can withstand balloon dilation, inhibiting excessive smooth muscle cell proliferation and preventing thrombus formation, and selenium species can also catalyze NO production and regulate cardiovascular homeostasis. Previous ISR prevention strategies rarely considered endothelial cell regeneration. This study increased endothelial cell adhesion and proliferation by grafting a hydrogel coating on the scaffold surface. The method has extensive research prospects.

Tugge et al. prepared a multifunctional "clickable" hydrogel coating through spin- coating [51], which enhanced the ability to move from protein fixation to cell attachment. Firstly, a dopamine methacrylamide layer was attached via catechol groups on the titanium surface. Then, furan- protected maleimide methacrylate (FuMaMA) hydrogels were prepared on the surface, and the furan groups were removed through a heating reaction, so that maleimide can react with sulfhydryl groups. Thus, the hydrogel can be functionalized by sulfhydryl maleimide nucleophilic addition and Diels- Alder cycloaddition reaction under mild conditions. The degree of functionalization of the hydrogel can be controlled by attachment of biotin- benzyltetrazine, followed by immobilization of TRITC- labelled ExtrAvidin, thus satisfying various biological properties. This method involves a simple synthetic principle and can couple various antibacterial substances, drugs, and biomolecules to achieve surface functionalization through various click reactions, allowing more diverse applications of hydrogel coatings. Liu prepared a polymer zwitterion coating based on poly(2- methacryloyloxyethylphosphorylcholine- co- dopamine methacrylate) (pMPCDA) copolymers with anti- inflammatory and antithrombotic properties [52], which are also used for blood- contacting catheters. In order to prepare such a uniform and stable coating, the PVC surface was amino functionalized by co- deposition of polydopamine (PDA) and polyvinyl imine. Then, based on various reaction mechanisms (e.g., Michael addition, Schiff- base addition) between catechol and amino groups, the zwitterionic pMPCDA copolymer was stably modified on the surface of PVC by using the mussel shell excitation chemical method. The hydrogel coating is not degradable, but degradable devices can reduce long- term complications in association with the residue of foreign materials in the body. Yang et al. prepared a membrane based on FDA- approved biodegradable Poly L- lactic acid (PLLA) material. First, dopamine (DA) groups are introduced on the surface of PLLA. Then, it is immersed in a synthetic Sulfobetaine methacrylate/Cerium oxide@Methacrylated gelatin dopamine conjugate (SBMA/CeO2@GMDA) solution. After Michael addition and Schiff base reaction, the nanoceria- eluting degradable zwitterion hydrogel coating is fabricated (Figure 3) [53].

#### 2.1.4. Introduction of Silane Coupling Agents on the Substrate Surface

Silane coupling agents may modify the surface of most inorganic or organic materials by introducing various functional groups as reaction sites, such as amine, aldehyde, thiol, vinyl, and quaternary ammonium groups [54]. Among them, the quaternary ammonium salt group has been proven by many researchers to have a very effective antibacterial ability. These reactive sites contribute to the adhesion of hydrogel coatings [55]. For example, Wu Xiaofang et al. studied an antibacterial hydrogel- coated artificial joint prosthesis [56]. In this study, the silane- coupling agent was loaded on the surface of laser- treated titanium alloy with hydrogen bonds; then, chitosan gelatin mixed hydrogel was prepared, which was immersed in nano- silver solution to form CS- GT- nAg antibacterial hydrogel. Using the 3D printing method, the hydrogel was connected with silane coupling agents by covalent bond and hydrogen bond, and firmly attached to the titanium alloy. The hydrogel coating has a dual- scale porous network structure, and the composite coating constructed by applying this method is more uniform and less prone to peeling, improving biocompatibility and antibacterial properties compared with porous coatings prepared by sol- gel [57], microarc oxidation [58], and laser sintering methods [59]. Refer to Table 2 for the above information.

### 2.2. Anchoring the Hydrogel Coating to the Substrate Surface

2.2. Anchoring the Hydrogel Coating to the Substrate SurfaceThe preparation of stable polymer brushes on the material surface is possible by initiating graft- crosslinking polymerization on the substrate surface, which introduces a high density of reaction sites. However, the reaction efficiency is low, and the preparation of hydrogel coatings on the material surface does not require too many reaction sites. In general terms, the hydrogel can be thought of as a large molecule; immobilization on the material surface improves the coating binding stability and reaction efficiency.

#### 2.2.1. Click Chemistry for Anchoring Hydrogels to the Substrate Surface

2.2.1. Click Chemistry for Anchoring Hydrogels to the Substrate SurfaceClick chemistry has contributed significantly to the chemical synthesis field [60]. It has many applications, high yields, harmless byproducts, and simple reaction conditions. It is a widely used method in the field of biomedical research and includes the azide- alkyne cycloaddition reaction (AAC) [61], thiolene reaction [62], and Diels- Alder reaction [63]. The thiolene reaction is widely used for preparing hydrogel coatings due to its high reaction efficiency and fast gel formation. Magennis et al. functionalized polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) with the silane coupling agent MTS [64]. Then, they used the introduced thiol groups as reaction sites to crosslink with multifunctional monomers to prepare hydrogel coatings immobilized on the substrate surface. The in vitro experiments showed effective bacterial growth inhibition compared to unmodified PDMS.

#### 2.2.2. Dopamine Group Functionalized Hydrogels Anchored on the Substrate Surface

Introducing dopamine groups into the hydrogel structure and anchoring on the substrate surface may avoid complicated pretreatment procedures on the substrate surface and improve the reaction efficiency.

Leng Jin et al. constructed a  \(\mathrm{ZnO}\)  layer with a nanoflower- like structure on a titanium surface by a hydrothermal method and then prepared a hybrid hydrogel of gelatine methacrylate (GelMA) and hyaluronic acid methacrylate (HAMA), which was firmly attached to the  \(\mathrm{ZnO}\)  layer by grafting catechol motifs on the hydrogel and conducting photocrosslinking (Figure 4) [65]. The composite could self- adapt. Under normal conditions, the hydrogel coating is stable and may effectively reduce the toxicity of  \(\mathrm{ZnO}\) . However, when bacterial infection occurs, the hydrogel coating can be effectively degraded by enzymes to release  \(\mathrm{ZnO}\)  for antibacterial purposes, which further regulates the biological behavior of fibroblasts and exhibits good soft tissue compatibility while effectively balancing biosafety and antibacterial activity.

He Ye et al. used the same method to prepare catechol motif- modified gelatine methacrylate containing photosensitizer Chlorin co- loaded mesoporous polydopamine nanoparticles (GelMAc/MPDA@Ce6), which were firmly attached to the titanium after  \(365~\mathrm{nm}\)  UV for  \(10\mathrm{min}\)  [66]. Then, the photobiomodulation (PBM) method and photodynamic therapy (PDT) was performed by laser irradiation at specific wavelengths, which enabled the Ce6 photosensitizer to be activated to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and combine with other biomolecules to promote tissue repair. The coating exhibited effective antibacterial properties and promoted cell adhesion and proliferation. Combining PBM methods with hydrogel coatings of biomaterials to achieve biological functions is relatively novel and promising. Both studies used catechol moieties as anchoring groups to graft hydrogel coatings. The anchoring principle of catechol is that large amine groups, phenolic hydroxyls, and quinone structures formed by the oxidation of the derivative deposition layer may function as reactive sites to couple to initiators of active/controllable radical polymerization, which can be helpful in grafting antibacterial hydrogel coatings onto substrates. Catechol is an important pharmaceutical intermediate that can firmly attach a hydrogel coating to the substrate and is now widely used in biomaterials.

#### 2.2.3. Anchoring Hydrogel Layers by Free Radical Polymerization

The attachment of the hydrogel layer involves first prefixing the initiator on the substrate surface; then, the hydrogel precursor solution is polymerized on the substrate surface. In addition, instead of initiating polymerization on the surface, the hydrogel layer may initiate polymerization in the precursor solution and then be chemically anchored to the substrate surface through grafting groups on the surface of the hydrogel layer.

Liu Chengde et al. prepared a bifunctional nanocomposite hydrogel coating on the surface of poly(aryl ether ketone) PAEK implants [67,68]. The raw materials for hydrogel preparation included type A gelatine, acrylic acid (AA), N- succinimidyl acrylate (AAc- NHS ester), nano- hydroxyapatite, and methacrylic anhydride (MA). As shown in Figure 5, bulk nanocomposite hydrogels were first prepared by dissolving AA, GelMA, AAc- NHS ester, and  \(\alpha\) - ketoglutaric acid (KGA) in deionized water, then mixed with nanohydroxyapatite in different proportions and cured in an ultraviolet light (UV) chamber for 15 min [69,70]. A novel poly (phthalazinone ether sulfone ketone) containing allyl groups (APPBAESK) was spin- coated on the surface of PPBESK. Then, the already prepared bulk hydrogel was spin- coated on the surface and crosslinked under UV irradiation to form the coating. NHS- ester activated groups and nano- HA were introduced to endow tissue adhesivity and osteogenic activity. Chemically inert PPBESK was successfully functionalized by spin- coating of APPBAESK containing allyl groups. The nanocomposite hydrogel coating containing nano- HA and NHS- ester activated groups was chemically anchored on the surface of modified PPBESK, which greatly improved its hydrophilicity. The resulting bifunctional PPBESK could adhere to tissues quickly and with high adhesion strength up to 300 KPa in pig skin. In addition, osteoblasts and fibroblasts could adhere and proliferate well on the surface of nanocomposite hydrogel coatings on PPBESK. Importantly, ALP expression and osteoblastic differentiation of preosteoblasts cultured with modified PPBESK were promoted by the nanocomposite hydrogel coating containing nano- HA. In conclusion, this
